# DataScienceProject-LoanDefaultPrediction
This project addresses loan default prediction using machine learning to help financial institutions minimize risks and allocate resources effectively. Using a dataset of borrowers, we will develop models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify high-risk borrowers, evaluate performance, and enhance decision-making processes.
